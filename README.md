### 🚀 **Features**

- A 3D bowling alley environment created using Three.js.
- Basic gameplay mechanics for VR bowling.
- Separate code files for better modularity and organization.
- Folder structure with multiple assets ready for production (except main assets).
- Bowling pins are currently static but designed to be developed for unique rotations upon collision.
